# GD-FOLD
A gradient descent-based algorithm for solving the fuel-optimal soft landing problem.

GD-FOLD is based on Lars Blackmore's work with G-FOLD (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258676350_G-FOLD_A_Real-Time_Implementable_Fuel_Optimal_Large_Divert_Guidance_Algorithm_for_Planetary_Pinpoint_Landing). However, instead of convex optimization, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used to optimize the objective function to find the optimal trajectory.
